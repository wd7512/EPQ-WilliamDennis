#### Introduction:
My reasearch project is to compare the differances in 3 major programming languages: Python 3, Java and C#. I will use past GCSE coursework material to base my projects on. For the python projects I will use IDLE on my desktop and for Java and C# I will use Visual Studio Community

I will use past GCSE cousework tasks as the programmes I shall create in each language. They can be found in the GCSE Tasks folder.

##### [Controlled Assessment Material 1](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/GCSE%20Tasks/A453CA1Jun15_104064.pdf) 

###### Task1:
This task involves 3 inputs: 2 time inputs and an identification input. Since the output will be a list as specified, the inputs can either be on a repeated loop or reading a text file.

The process will be finding the differance between the two time inputs and calculating speed from the known distance. If the speed is above what the the speed limit is, in which the user can set (thus adding a 4th input), the number plate will be added to a list of speeding cars.

This output can then be displayed or added to a text file.

###### Task2:
This task involves 1 input of a number plate in string form which will need to be checked if its in the correct formatt.

The process of this is that firstly the length should be checked, then a loop that will check each charecter in the string is correct.

###### Task3:
This task involves there being 2 text files in which they both must be read so that their data is compiled together into a third text file.

This will be done by finding then reading the specific item that connects the both and extracting the relevant data from both of them.
