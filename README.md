##### Introduction:
My reasearch project is to compare the differances in 3 major programming languages: Python 3, Java and C#. I will use past GCSE coursework material to base my projects on. For the python projects I will use IDLE on my desktop and for Java and C# I will use Visual Studio Community

I will use past GCSE cousework tasks as the programmes I shall create in each language. They can be found in the [GCSE Tasks](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/tree/master/GCSE%20Tasks) folder.
