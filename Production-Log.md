After discussion with co-ordinator, my question has changed. I have looked at spotify's [API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/)  
* This requires node.js, so i have installed it from the node.js [website](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
  * I have hence run a quick test  
![Node Install](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/Pictures/Node%20Install.png?raw=true)  
  * I then followed the test setup on the website  
    * Doing firstly a set up test
![localhost](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/Pictures/localhost.png?raw=true)  
    * I then cloned the [files required](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples)
    * I then installed the package manager, npm
![npm install](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/Pictures/npm%20install.png?raw=true)
    * I then created a spotify developer client
![client setup](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/Pictures/client%20setup.png?raw=true)
    * I then added the client ID and client secret **but not redirect uri** as I do not own a redirect uri
![client ID](https://github.com/wd7512/EPQ-WilliamDennis/blob/master/Pictures/client%20ID.png?raw=true)
